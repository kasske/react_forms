# React js form handling

React js example, messing around with form handling possibilities 

## Validation

- On keystroke
- On lost focus
- On form submission

## Using

- state approach
- refs
- built in browser props
- combinig the above

## Practicality

- using reusable Input component
- using custom hook to outsource the logic
- using 3rd party libraries like react hook form or formik (not included, but it is possible)


## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
